Children will explore topics like colors, alphabets, seasons, shapes, numbers, and patterns. Through these activities, children learn, play, and work together, enhancing their communication and social skills while gaining knowledge in these themes. We aim to make learning so enjoyable that children are excited to come to school each day."
